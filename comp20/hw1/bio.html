<body>
	<p> My name is Rati Srinivasan. I am 21 years old and a current senior at Tufts University. I was born on March 7th, 1996 and lived in Glastonbury, CT for my entire childhood. My parents are immigrants from India. I have two siblings. My sister, Preeti, is 1.5 years older than me and my brother, Naveen, is 1.5 years younger than me. My siblings and I all went through the Glastonbury Public Schools system. </p>
	<p> I've been an independent traveller from a young age. My dad is a college professor and would often spend summers or semesters teaching abroad, so I would fly out to Italy or Peru or France to spend time exploring a new country while having family close by. By the beginning of high school, I had travelled to all but two of the fifty states. My love for travel continued through high school and college. I recently spent a summer in Japan and at the beginning of this summer vistied Turkey and South Africa. I've travelled to almost 30 countries. </p>
	<p> In college, I started to gain an interest in the medical field. Growing up with a mother as a physician, I was exposed to the medical field but not naturally inclined towards it. As I began to realize that the medical field was so much more than my biochemistry classes, my interest grew. Now, I work at Boston Children's Hospital and am applying to medical school. In my spare time, I'm usually finding a way to hang out with dogs.  </p>
