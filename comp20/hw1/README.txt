All aspects of this project seem to be working. All the HTML files and the CSS files were validated with no warnings or errors. Additionally, I checked the index site and clicked each link and everything was working well! I collaborated with Paulina Ash. This project took me about 6 hours to complete, but a lot of that time was spent learning basic beginning steps before actually setting up my HTML files.
